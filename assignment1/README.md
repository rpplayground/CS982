## Choice Of Dataset
I've chosen to load country level data from the World Bank to explore world development indicators such as:
- Economic indicators such as Gross Development Product (GDP)
- Population and mortallity rates

## Objectives
The obejctives I would like to achieve:
1. Wrangle the data into a more effective shape for analysis
2. Use simple techniques to fill in the gaps within the data
3. Application of science to show correlation between economic prosperity and life expectancy
4. Use of predictive analysis to forward project point at which world population plateaus based on some broad assumptions
5. Use of simple visuals to enable compelling story telling 
 
## Sourcing the Data
Instructions about how I sourced the data.
Notes about licensing.

## Pre-requisites
The environment I have chose to use to complete this assignment is as follows:
- Visual Studio Code - Microsoft's free and open source integrated development environment
- Python - as thew core development environment - extended with a number of core libraries : numpy, pandas XXX
- Jupyter Notebooks - used to orchestrate the process that I've followed to take the data through the end to end value chain
- Markdown - use of markdown as the means of generating integrated notes within the Jupyter notebooks
- PyTest - used for running unit tests on any bespoke functions developed to support this project
